# How I Set Up a Self-Hosted Technitium DNS Server on Ubuntu 24.04 (Without Tying It to Kubernetes)

I've been gradually moving my self-hosted services into Kubernetes clusters, but one thing I wanted to keep outside that setup was DNS. I needed something lightweight, easy to manage, and ideally something that supported **RFC 2136** for dynamic DNS updates. After digging around, I landed on [Technitium DNS](https://technitium.com/dns/)—a simple, open-source DNS server that doesn't require a PhD in networking to get running.

Here’s how I set it up on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 container. If you're like me and just want something that works without bloated overhead, this might help.

---

## Why Keep DNS Outside the Cluster?

I plan to eventually run most of my homelab services on Kubernetes, but DNS is a foundational service. If the cluster goes down or gets misconfigured, I still want DNS resolution working so I can troubleshoot things. Plus, since **Technitium supports RFC 2136**, I’ll later be able to push DNS entries dynamically—like when new pods or services spin up. That’ll be a game-changer.

---

## Step 1: Spinning Up a Fresh Ubuntu 24.04 Container

I'm using an LXC container on my Proxmox server, but this would work just the same on a bare-metal install or a VM.

First thing: I avoid working directly as `root`, so I created a user:

```bash
sudo adduser myuser
sudo usermod -aG sudo myuser
```

After that, I logged in with the new user and updated the system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 2: Basic Hardening (Just Enough)

Before installing anything, I set up a basic firewall and Fail2Ban.

### Firewall (UFW)

Technitium uses a few specific ports, so I allowed those plus SSH:

```bash
# SSH
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

# DNS (TCP/UDP)
sudo ufw allow 53/tcp
sudo ufw allow 53/udp

# Technitium Web UI & API
sudo ufw allow 5380/tcp
sudo ufw allow 53443/tcp

# DoT/DoH
sudo ufw allow 853/tcp
sudo ufw allow 853/udp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/udp

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

### Fail2Ban

Just install it and go:

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
```

No extra config needed unless you're being targeted heavily.

---

## Step 3: Install Technitium DNS

Technitium has an official script that makes installation dead simple:

```bash
curl -sSL https://download.technitium.com/dns/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Once it’s done, I verified the service was running:

```bash
systemctl status dns.service
```

Should say `active (running)` in green. Nice.

---

## Step 4: First Login and Web UI Setup

To access the web interface, I opened my browser and went to:

```
http://<server-ip>:5380/
```

It asked for login. The default username is `admin` and it provided a prompt to change the password.
Once done with that, I logged in with the new password.

---

## Step 5: Basic Configuration

Once I was in the dashboard, I did a couple of things right away:

### 1. Ad Blocking

Technitium has a **Block Lists** tab. I grabbed a few public blocklists and added them there to handle ads and trackers at the DNS level.

### 2. Local DNS Records

This is where it gets cool. Under the **Zones** tab, I created a new zone for `local.homelab.` and added A records like:

Going forward, I will be creating two more zones for my k8s clusters: `testing.local.homelab.` and `production.local.homelab.` and add the A records for the nodes in each cluster in the `local.homelab.` zone.

Now I don’t have to remember IPs. Later, I’ll script these entries to be added dynamically as services come and go using RFC 2136.

---

## Final Step: Make Devices Use It

To finish things off, I went into my router's DHCP settings and changed the primary DNS to point to this new Technitium server.

Now all devices on my network are using it by default.

---

## What's Next

Eventually, I want all my workloads—including Grafana, InfluxDB, and some app stacks—running in Kubernetes. When that happens, I’ll write a small controller or script to register services dynamically via RFC 2136.

Keeping DNS separate means I won’t accidentally break name resolution when I’m messing with the cluster.

Technitium might not be the most talked-about tool, but for a homelab like mine—it just works. Zero fuss.

Happy labbing!
