## My First Hour with Proxmox: From Fresh Install to Lab-Ready

I just finished a fresh installation of Proxmox on my new homelab server, and the feeling was electric. Staring at that clean web interface, my mind was already racing with all the virtual machines and containers I could create—a self-hosted cloud, a powerful pfSense firewall, or isolated environments for the various open-source projects I find interesting and want to test.

But I stopped myself. Before diving into the fun stuff, I knew that spending a little time on a solid foundation would pay off immensely. So, I decided to dedicate the first hour to essential housekeeping to make my server stable, secure, and ready for experimentation. Here's a walkthrough of exactly what I did, including the little bumps I hit and fixed along the way.

### Step 1: Kicking Things Off with the First Update

First things first. Just like any new OS, I needed to pull down all the latest security patches and updates. I logged into the Proxmox shell as `root` and ran two simple commands:

```bash
# First, I refreshed the list of available packages
apt update

# Then, I installed all the updates
apt dist-upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Creating My Own User (and a Sudo Surprise)

Working as the `root` user all the time is a bad habit, as a single typo can cause major damage. My next step was to create a personal user account and give it administrative rights using `sudo`. I decided to name my user `sbose`.

```bash
# I created the user account
useradd sbose

# Then I went to add my new user to the 'sudo' group
usermod -aG sudo sbose

# Finally, I set a password for the account
passwd sbose
```
Here’s where I hit my first unexpected snag. When I tried to actually use `sudo`, it turned out the `sudo` package wasn't installed by default on my minimal Proxmox installation! The fix was quick. I switched back to root and installed it:

```bash
# As root, I installed the sudo package
apt install sudo
```
With `sudo` now installed, my `sbose` user, being a member of the `sudo` group, finally had the administrative powers I wanted.

### Step 3: My Second "Oops!" Moment (and the Fix)

Eager to use my new account, I tried to switch to it using `su - sbose`, but I was immediately met with another warning:

`su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/sbose: No such file or directory`

Ah, of course. The `useradd` command created the user, but it didn't create their home folder on the server. Luckily, the fix was straightforward.

```bash
# I created the home directory that was missing
mkdir /home/sbose

# Then I gave my 'sbose' user ownership of it
chown sbose:sbose /home/sbose
```
I also noticed the default command-line shell was a bit basic. I prefer using `bash`, so I ran one more command as root to set it as the default for my user:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/bash sbose
```

After logging out and back in as `sbose`, everything was perfect. I had a proper home directory and a powerful `bash` shell.

### Step 4: Securing the Front Door—Hardening SSH

With my user account in good shape, it was time to secure the server's main entrance: the SSH port. I wanted to disable direct root login and move towards using secure SSH keys instead of passwords.

Using my new account with its sudo powers, I opened the SSH configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Inside the file, I found and changed two important lines:

```
# I changed this to 'no' to prevent root login over SSH
PermitRootLogin no

# I also set this to 'no' to disable password-based logins
# (Important: I made sure my SSH key was already set up first!)
PasswordAuthentication no
```
After saving the file, I applied the changes by restarting the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 5: Prepping for Advanced Projects with PCI Passthrough

One of my future goals for this server is to run more complex projects that might need direct access to physical hardware. For example, I might want to pass a dedicated multi-port network card to a pfSense or OPNsense firewall VM, or perhaps a special controller card to a storage VM. To make that possible, I needed to enable a feature called IOMMU (which is called VT-d on my Intel system).

First, I had to reboot and enable `VT-d` in my server's BIOS. Once that was done and I was back in Proxmox, I performed the following steps:

1.  **I edited the GRUB bootloader configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    ```
    I changed the line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on"`.

2.  **I updated GRUB to apply the change:**
    ```bash
    sudo update-grub
    ```
3.  **I told the system to load the necessary kernel modules at boot:**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/modules
    ```
    I added these four lines to the file:
    ```
    vfio
    vfio_iommu_type1
    vfio_pci
    vfio_virqfd
    ```
4.  **Finally, I rebooted the entire server** for these deep system changes to take effect:
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

### Bonus Tip: Hiding the Annoying Subscription Nag

Since this is a homelab, I'm not using a paid Proxmox subscription. That means a little "No valid subscription" nag appears every time I log in. It's harmless, but annoying. I found a handy one-liner command to hide it.

Running as `root`, I first made a backup of the file, just in case:

```bash
# Always make a backup first!
cp /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js.bak
```
Then I used this `sed` command to patch the file and restarted the web service:
```bash
# This command finds the part that shows the message and disables it
sed -Ezi.bak "s/(Ext.Msg.show\(\{\s+title: gettext\('No valid sub)/void\(\{ \/\/\1/g" /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js

# A quick restart to apply the change
systemctl restart pveproxy.service
```
No more nag!

### And I'm Done!

With the server back online, my initial setup was complete. In just about an hour, I had managed to update the system, create a secure daily-driver user, harden SSH, and lay the groundwork for my future experiments. My Proxmox server now feels solid, secure, and truly ready for anything I want to throw at it.

Now, for the real fun—it's time to start exploring some open-source projects.
