## From Code Request to Live Site: An Automations Engineer Deploys a React App (Mostly Blind!) 

Alright folks, gather 'round the virtual water cooler.

As an Automations Engineer, my day-to-day involves Git wrangling, CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts, and generally making sure things flow smoothly from code commit to running service. Infrastructure? Got it. Automation? Love it. But ask me about the finer points of React state management, Vite's HMR, or the magic behind Tailwind CSS? Yeah, that's... not my core competency.

Despite that, I needed a personal website – **Server Sanctum** – and decided to see if I could get one running at `serversanctum.in` without actually *learning* frontend development in depth. Spoilers: I did, mostly by treating AI as a "code generation service" and focusing on the part I *do* know: deploying the resulting artifact.

Here's how this little experiment in deploying the semi-unknown went down:

### Step 1: Requesting the Artifact Specs (AI & Git)

Instead of firing up a code editor myself, I tasked an AI assistant (like ChatGPT/Claude) with generating the frontend boilerplate. "Give me a React portfolio site using Vite and Tailwind CSS," I said (more or less). It dutifully generated a pile of `.jsx`, `.css`, and config files.

While I didn't deeply understand the component structure or the styling logic, I knew what to do with *code*. Standard procedure: `git init`, get it into a new GitHub repo, commit often. At least the source was under version control, even if it felt a bit like a black box.

### Step 2: Building the CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

This part felt like home turf. Manually running `npm run build` and copying files? No thanks. Automation is key.

I grabbed a standard-looking GitHub Actions workflow template (likely provided by the AI or found in docs) and dropped it into `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The steps were familiar concepts:

1.  Checkout code.
2.  Setup Node.js environment.
3.  Run `npm install` (dependency management, standard stuff).
4.  Execute the build command (`npm run build`) – this is where Vite does its magic, turning the React source into static HTML/CSS/JS files in a `dist` folder. This `dist` folder is the deployment artifact I care about.
5.  Use the `actions/deploy-pages` action to push that `dist` artifact to the GitHub Pages environment.

Setting this up was straightforward. Now, any `git push` to the `main` branch automatically triggers the build and deployment. Efficiency achieved!

### Step 3: Pointing the Pipes (Custom Domain & DNS)

Deploying to `username.github.io` is fine, but `serversanctum.in` looks cleaner. Time for DNS configuration – another familiar area.

*   **GitHub Config:** Added a `CNAME` file to the repo containing just `serversanctum.in`. This tells the GitHub Pages service which domain to respond to.
*   **Hostinger Config:** Logged into my domain registrar (Hostinger) and configured the DNS records:
    *   Four `A` records for the root domain (`@`) pointing to the standard GitHub Pages IP addresses.
    *   A `CNAME` record for `www` aliasing it to my default GitHub Pages URL (`subhobose0003.github.io.`).

Standard DNS stuff. Point the records, wait for propagation. Done.

### Step 4: Dealing with Frontend Quirks (The Black Box Bites Back)

Here's where my lack of frontend framework knowledge required some targeted debugging, mostly focused on *why the deployed artifact wasn't behaving as expected*.

1.  **`vite.config.js` - Asset Paths:** The first deployment looked broken – missing styles and scripts. Turns out, Vite needed `base: '/'` in its config file (`vite.config.js`) to generate correct relative paths for assets when served from the root of a custom domain. Had to ask the AI/search specifically about "Vite deployment custom domain asset paths" to find this. It wasn't an infrastructure issue, but a build tool configuration specific to this frontend stack.
2.  **The SPA Routing vs. Static Hosting Conflict:** This was the main integration challenge. The React app uses client-side routing (React Router). This means the browser handles changing the view for URLs like `/about` *without* asking the server for a new page. But GitHub Pages is a static file server. Refreshing on `/about` caused GitHub Pages to look for `/about/index.html`, which the Vite build doesn't create, resulting in a 404.
    *   **The Fix (Infrastructure Workaround):** The solution felt like a classic deployment hack. I added a `postbuild` script (`"postbuild": "cp dist/index.html dist/404.html"`) to duplicate the main `index.html` as `404.html`. This makes GitHub Pages serve the main app when it encounters a 404.
    *   **The Frontend Shim:** Then, some JavaScript (provided by AI/Docs, had to trust it mostly) runs when the app loads. It checks if it was loaded via the 404 redirect and uses the browser's History API to silently update the URL back to what the user requested (e.g., `/about`), allowing React Router to take over. Debugging this required understanding the *interaction* between the static server and the client-side framework's assumptions.

### Step 5: Ship It! 

With the build config corrected and the SPA routing workaround in place:

1.  Commit changes.
2.  `git push origin main`.
3.  Watch the GitHub Action pipeline turn green. 

Checked `serversanctum.in`, tested navigation, hit refresh on different pages – success! The deployment pipeline worked, and the frontend artifact behaved correctly in the static hosting environment.

### Next Steps & Known Issues (It's a V1!)

Okay, let's be real – while the deployment pipeline is humming along nicely, the site itself is definitely a "version 1.0".

*   **Optimization Needed:** I haven't really dug into optimizing the frontend build yet. Image sizes, code splitting, bundle analysis – that's all stuff the frontend pros worry about, and it's currently untouched territory for me. I'm sure there are improvements to be made for load times.
*   **More Features Incoming:** This is just the starting point. I definitely want to add more interactive elements down the line. A big one on my list is figuring out how to integrate a **comment box**. That'll likely involve exploring third-party services or maybe even another AI-assisted adventure into backend APIs!
*   **Continuous Learning (Mostly Deployment Side):** I'll keep refining the deployment process and maybe look into things like preview environments, but the core automation is solid for now.

### Engineer's Takeaways

*   **AI as a Boilerplate Generator:** It's incredibly useful for scaffolding code in domains you don't specialize in (like frontend).
*   **Integration is Key:** The generated code still needs to be integrated into proper version control and deployment pipelines.
*   **Black Boxes Have Quirks:** Deploying frontend frameworks often requires understanding *how* they interact with the hosting infrastructure (like the SPA routing issue). Build tool configuration (`vite.config.js`) matters for deployment.
*   **Troubleshooting Requires Bridging Gaps:** Even without deep frontend knowledge, understanding deployment concepts helped isolate issues (like incorrect asset paths or server 404s) and ask the AI/search more targeted questions to find the frontend-specific solutions.

So, while Server Sanctum isn't perfectly polished under the hood yet, it's *live*, and the deployment process is automated – which satisfies the engineer in me! It proves you can get surprisingly far by leveraging AI and focusing on solid deployment practices, even when the application code itself is a bit of a mystery.

Check out the deployed artifact at [https://serversanctum.in](https://serversanctum.in)! Stay tuned for future updates (and maybe more deployment tales!). Let me know your thoughts!
