# Building a New GitOps Workflow for My Homelab: An Experiment

Hey everyone,

If you're anything like me, your homelab is a passion project—a place to learn, tinker, and maybe run a few useful services for yourself. But as my own lab has grown, I've found myself spending more time managing the complexity than actually innovating. It's time for a change.

So, I'm starting a new experiment: to build a robust, streamlined GitOps workflow from the ground up, tailored specifically for my homelab. My motivation is to create a system that's not just automated but also safe and predictable, allowing me to deploy changes with confidence.

I'm documenting the plan here as I go. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure how it will all turn out. Will it be the perfect solution, or will I hit roadblocks I haven't anticipated? Let's find out together!

### The Foundation: Repository Structure

Before diving into the branching, I need a solid directory structure. I'm going with a Kustomize-inspired layout to keep a clean separation between infrastructure, applications, and different environments. The plan is to structure it like this:

```
homelabs/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/          # GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
│
├── infrastructure/         # Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Talos configs)
│   ├── base/               # Common infrastructure definitions
│   └── overlays/           # Environment-specific configurations
│       ├── production/
│       └── testing/
│
├── apps/                   # Kubernetes application manifests
│   ├── base/               # Base manifests for applications
│   └── overlays/           # Environment-specific overrides
│       ├── production/
│       └── testing/
│
└── README.md
```

### The Workflow in Detail

The core of my GitOps strategy is a three-branch system (`main`, `develop`, and feature branches) designed to move changes from idea to production in a controlled and predictable way. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

**Step 1: Feature Development (`feat` branches)**

*   **Branching:** All new development, whether it's a new application, a configuration change, or a bug fix, begins on a dedicated feature branch (e.g., `feat/add-new-service`). This branch is created from the `develop` branch.
*   **Automated Preview:** As soon as I push commits to the feature branch, a CI/CD pipeline automatically kicks in. It builds the necessary components and deploys them to a temporary, isolated **preview environment** within my testing cluster. This gives me a live, sandboxed space to test the specific changes without impacting anything else.
*   **Verification:** I can then manually verify the changes in the preview environment. If something isn't right, I can continue pushing commits to the branch, which will update the preview environment with each push.

**Step 2: Integration and Staging (`develop` branch)**

*   **Merging:** Once I'm satisfied with the feature, I merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch.
*   **Staging Deployment:** This merge acts as a trigger for the next stage of the pipeline. First, the pipeline automatically tears down the temporary preview environment to keep things clean. Then, it deploys the newly integrated code from `develop` into the main **testing environment**. This environment is a more stable, shared space that mirrors production, allowing me to conduct integration testing and ensure the new changes work well with the existing setup.
*   **Final Verification:** I perform another round of manual verification in the testing environment. If any issues arise here, it means I need to go back to step 1, create a new feature branch to fix the problem, and repeat the process.

**Step 3: Production Deployment (`main` branch)**

*   **Promotion to Main:** After the changes have been thoroughly vetted in the testing environment, the `develop` branch is merged into the `main` branch. This merge is the final, manual gate before production.
*   **Live Deployment:** The merge to `main` triggers the production pipeline, which takes the code and deploys it to the **production cluster**.
*   **Done:** The feature is now live and running in my homelab.

This structured flow ensures that nothing reaches production without being tested first in isolation and then in an integrated staging environment, giving me confidence in every deployment.

### The Big Question: Will It Work?

This workflow looks solid on paper, but the real test is in the implementation. Will it bring the order and safety I'm looking for, or will it just add another layer of complexity?

I'll be sharing my progress, the hurdles I encounter, and the lessons I learn along the way. Wish me luck, and I hope you'll follow along on this little adventure!

Happy labbing!
